#  ðŸŽ¯ Aim of the game ðŸŽ¯
This project procedural RPG that generates a cohesive world where every interaction is non-scripted, and every choice generates new opportunities. Work began within year two of our university studies, with the general goal to be an advanced piece of C++ code, with a focus towards OPP concepts. 
## ðŸ“– General Premise ðŸ“–
A player will travel the world in vain attempt to become the richest family; in their quest they will fail several times, but with each generation a new heir takes up the mantle, and the quest begins again. Using skills and abilities each hand-crafted interaction feels like a story that you are in control of, at the helm of your familyâ€™s destiny. One of the main features that the game will promote is the creation of a family story. Each generation add to a player viewable script of each choice that they have made. 

This dream of riches forces the player to leave the village and begin questing. Confronted with a world divided into pathed nodes, traversing the perilous land will be challenging at first. Stumbling through it the player will be greeted by events that they will have to solve with each event being procedurally generated with a custom NPC and a storyline that the player can affect. Thus, gain gold or loose reputation and possibility their life.

Lives for the player re unique so when the player dies their armour, their items and XP are lost, but their gold, inheritable traits, and his farther faithful guitar are kept. This allows for progression meaning the more lives played the more money generated. Each life offered a possibility to reach the one million mark that earns them the title of richest in the land.
