# Aim of the game
A procedural RPG that generates a cohesive world where every interaction is non-scripted, and every choice generates new opportunities.  A player will travel the world in vain attempt to become the richest family; in his quest they will fail several times, but with each generation a new heir takes up the mantle, and the quest begins again. Using skills and abilities each hand-crafted interaction feels like a story that you are in control of, at the helm of your familyâ€™s destiny.

One of the main features that the game will promote is the creation of a family story. Each generation add to a player viewable script of each choice that they have made, linking the differences and choice that each child/heir names. 

A player being a lowly and destitute peasant that dreams of riches. It starts as this dream forces the player to leave the village and begin questions. Confronted with a world divided into small squares traversing the perilous land will be challenging at first. Stumbling through it the player will be greeted by events that they will have to solve. Each event will be procedurally generated with a custom NPC and storyline that the player can affect. Thus, gain gold or loose reputation and possibility their life.
Task before the player is unique so when the player dies their armour, their items and XP are lost, but their gold, inheritable traits, and his farther faithful guitar are kept. This allows for progression meaning the more lives played the more money generated. Each life offered a possibility to reach the one million mark that earns them the title of richest in the land.
