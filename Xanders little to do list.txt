==ITEMS==
Implement real item class
Store items of every kind in same inventory (Relic, food, weapon, and anything else we decide on)
Find a way to have Relics affect your stats (e.g. dread +1 or gold *2)
    add addEffects() and removeEffects() to member functions and execute them when adding and removing items


==EVENTS==
Implement attacksuccess.txt to generate random attack victory text at the end of each fight
Maybe add <walk> and <say> and similar elements to event text to increase text variation, these words will be pulled from a database of synonyms
    for instance "You <walk> to the bar" will become "You amble to the bar" or "You stroll to the bar"
Find a way to pass the NPC object through to the event rather than just their name and weapon name 
    when this is finished, give the NPC an inventory, and add a looting system to take their items or weapons and add them to the player inventory
Add biome list


==PLAYER==
Tidy up player name generation
Maybe create database of Mottos to randomly select from
Create weapon inventory that works
Limit weapon inventory to 3 weapons
    if a player finds or buys a new weapon they will have to decide which to get rid of
